# Markdown-Previewer

We can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project.

Step #1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

Step #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

Step #3: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

Step #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

Step#6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.
